This was my second solo project for my computer science class in secondary school. This project is vastly better in terms of quality and complexity compared to my last solo project.

The purpose of this project was to filter a dataset about the top rated albums of all time on albumoftheyear.org, and then visualise the data. I also had to create a system that would collect 3 different types of data from the user, which is where I created a album
recommendation system, using those three data types. The total amount of albums I chose to limit this project to was 500, since I found that to be the most reasonable amount for this project. Sorry if you hoped for more haha :P.

This project was mainly programmed using HTML, CSS, and Python with added libraries. You might need to install those needed on python if you WANT to run (which isn't necessary for it to work) and modify the files I've made... I'll list down what 
libaries I used anyway for each programming language I used anyway :D.
